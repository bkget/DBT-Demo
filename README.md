## DBT-Demo project: `jaffle_shop`

`jaffle_shop` is a fictional ecommerce store. This dbt project transforms raw data from an app database into a customers and orders model ready for analytics.

### What is this repo?
What this repo _is_:
- A self-contained playground dbt project, useful for testing out scripts, and communicating some of the core dbt concepts.

### What's in this repo?
This repo contains [seeds](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/seeds) that includes some (fake) raw data from a fictional app.

The raw data consists of customers, orders, and payments, with the following entity-relationship diagram:

### Running this project
To get up and running with this project:
1. Install dbt using [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation).

2. Clone this repository.

3. Change into the `jaffle_shop` directory from the command line:
```bash
$ cd jaffle_shop_dbt
```

4. Set up a profile called `jaffle_shop` to connect to a data warehouse by following [these instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile). You can setup a local postgres database and connect to it in your profile like I did in the project.

5. Ensure your profile is setup correctly from the command line:
```bash
$ dbt debug
```

6. Load the CSVs with the demo data set. This materializes the CSVs as tables in your target schema. Note that a typical dbt project **does not require this step** since dbt assumes your raw data is already in your warehouse.
```bash
$ dbt seed
```

7. Run the models:
```bash
$ dbt run
```

> **NOTE:** If this steps fails, it might mean that you need to make small changes to the SQL in the models folder to adjust for the flavor of SQL of your target database. Definitely consider this if you are using a community-contributed adapter.

8. Test the output of the models:
```bash
$ dbt test
```

9. Generate documentation for the project:
```bash
$ dbt docs generate
```

10. View the documentation for the project:
```bash
$ dbt docs serve
```
